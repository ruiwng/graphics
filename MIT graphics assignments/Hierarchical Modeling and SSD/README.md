# Hierarchical Modeling and SSD's features
1. show skeletons and joints using hierarchical model
2. show skin using SSD(Skeletal Subspace Deformation)
3. change the joints' Euler angles by fltk user interface, if you want to know more about fltk, please turn to www.fltk.org
4. update position and normal of the mesh on the fly using matrix stack, when transforming the joints
