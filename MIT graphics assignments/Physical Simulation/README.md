# Physical Simulation's features
1. implement two types of time steper: Forward Euler and Trapzoidal
2. compute three types of force: gravity, viscous drag and spring
3. realize three simulations: rotated ball, pendulum and cloth
4. generate discrete particles and mesh, the normal of every particle is computed using the mean number of all four near triangles' normals.
